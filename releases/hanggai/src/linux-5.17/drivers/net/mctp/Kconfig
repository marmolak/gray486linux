	  This driver provides an MCTP-over-serial interface, through a
	  serial line-discipline, as defined by DMTF specification "DSP0253 -
	  MCTP Serial Transport Binding". By attaching the ldisc to a serial
	  device, we get a new net device to transport MCTP packets.

	  This allows communication with external MCTP endpoints which use
	  serial as their transport. It can also be used as an easy way to
	  provide MCTP connectivity between virtual machines, by forwarding
	  data between simple virtual serial devices.

	  Say y here if you need to connect to MCTP endpoints over serial. To
	  compile as a module, use m; the module will be called mctp-serial.
